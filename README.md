Created a chatbox with Voiceflow

Project Summary – Voiceflow Cleaning Business Chatbot

I developed an interactive voice-enabled chatbot in Voiceflow to simulate customer service for a fictional cleaning business. The chatbot could engage in a natural conversation, gather customer details, generate quotes, and automatically store leads in a Google Sheet.

Key Features & Functionality:

Conversational Flow & Voice Interaction:

Supported natural, spoken conversation using text-to-speech and speech-to-text.

Guided customers through service-related questions in a friendly, step-by-step manner.

Data Collection:

Property Type – Collected whether the customer’s property was a House or Apartment.

Property Size – Gathered the property’s size in square feet.

Customer Details – Captured and confirmed the customer’s name and phone number.

Quote Generation:

Integrated with Relevance AI using its Quote Tool Generator to instantly calculate and provide a tailored price based on property type and size.

External Knowledge Base:

Added a custom PDF knowledge document containing business services, pricing, and FAQs, enabling the chatbot to answer detailed customer questions.

Automation & Lead Management:

Implemented a Make.com webhook to capture all conversation data in real time.

Data was sent directly to a connected Google Sheet, automatically updating the Leads worksheet with the new customer’s details and quote information.

Tools & Integrations Used:

Voiceflow – conversational design and flow logic.

Relevance AI – quote generation and context handling.

OpenAI – dynamic, natural response generation.

Make.com – webhook automation for data capture.

Google Sheets – lead database storage and updates.

Outcome:
The chatbot successfully simulated a fully functional cleaning business assistant, capable of quoting prices, answering questions, capturing leads, and automating lead management. This demonstrated the integration of conversational AI, data extraction, automation tools, and external APIs into a seamless customer experience.
